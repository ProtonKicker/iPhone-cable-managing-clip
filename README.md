# iPhone-cable-managing-clip
**have a messy table? use this clip to fix all problems!**
Sometimes my Apple lightning cable (for changing iPhones) is just to long. 
As a result, I cannot arrange it neatly. 
That is why I decided to make this simple and easy to 3D print clip that could potentially help you tidy up your desk.
## version 3.0 design release
A new design is made!

changes:
- wall thickness is reduced
- added 1 clip facing the reversed direction (same as v1.0)
- reduced 6 clips to 5
- added fillets

## version 2.0 print out analyses
here's a pic of the broken clip (I broke it in testing):

but it still works fine (it clips):

**there are definitely room for improvements**
1. the print quality is bad
2. clips a little bit too tight that the clip itself can be easily damanged

btw I just made some adjustments to my printer. this is the 1st print after the calibration, and having uneven surfaces are normal.

**possible solutions:**
- decrease wall thickness -> can be more flexible
- use PETG instead of PLA
- increase the space of the opening to make cables easier to get in

## version 2.0 design
This is some v2.0 design process screen shots, I haven't print it yet:

## version 1.0 printout&feedback
for my next step, I am going to:
- double the amount of clips: 6 instead of 3 as we have now -> compatible to longer cables
- make the clip stronger: adding wall thickness and making the opening smaller -> clips tighter

## version 1.0
this is my 1st try, here's a pic showing how v1.0 looks(printed out):

luckily, the thing works!
