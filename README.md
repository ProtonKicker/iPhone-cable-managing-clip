# iPhone-cable-managing-clip
**have a messy table? use this clip to fix all problems!**

Sometimes my Apple lightning cable (for changing iPhones) is just to long. As a result, I cannot arrange it neatly. 
That is why I decided to make this simple and easy to 3D print clip that could potentially help you tidy up your desk.

this is my 1st try, here's a pic showing how v1.0 looks(printed out):

This is some v2.0 design process screen shots, I haven't print it yet:

for my next step, I am going to:
- double the amount of clips: 6 instead of 3 as we have now -> compatible to longer cables
- make the clip stronger: adding wall thickness and making the opening smaller -> clip tighter
